## About
This plugin displays a table of the players in your current match, and their rank, MMR and games played across a customizable number of playlists.

The plugin is configurable:
- Display user platform
- Display when scoreboard is open (table can be positioned)
- Colours
  - Table rows and header
  - Teams
  - Ranks
  - Platform (Optional via plugin settings)
- Displayed Playlists
  - Unranked (Casual)
  - Ranked Duel
  - Ranked Twos
  - Ranked Threes
  - Tournament
  - Dropshot
  - Hoops
  - Rumble
  - Snowday

## Usage
**Important:** Make sure you have `Show Player MMR on scoreboard` check in the Bakkesmod settings, under the Ranked tab. Also check `Show MMR in casual playlists` for casual mode support.

You will want to adjust the plugin's settings in Bakkesmod. You can do this by pressing F2 and navigating to the settings tab. Selecting "Lobby Ranks" will display the settings.

In here you can:
- Enable the plugin
- Set it so the Lobby Ranks table displays when the scoreboard is open
- Adjust the table's anchor and position on screen
- More customization

Additionally, you can bind the `jlg_lobby_rank_toggle` command in the BakkesMod Bindings tab if you wish to toggle the table on key press.
